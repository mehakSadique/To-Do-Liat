 i would also later like to implement a note section which will also be a text fields
FrontEnd =>
I would use bootstrap, plain css/scss/sass
Html to create the elements like, list and checkbox input field
Database:
SInce this is a project i will create using php i will create a db_conn.php file that will connect the database using PDO php consistent way to access the database
I will first Create the connection by new PDO("mysql:host=$sName;dbname=$db_name", $uName, $password); by putting in a try and catch to see when connected
I will select all from table and order it by descending to put the most recent todo on top then i will link the input field to a database field, store all the data in there
Post data to database

File Structure => 
JS folder to have javascript and  jquery 
Img to hold images

App to hold all my php files
Index.php file on its own that will render everything 
Db_conn.php which will hold the database connection
